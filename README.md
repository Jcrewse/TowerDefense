# Idle Tower Defense
Author: Jack Crewse

A simple programming exercise to create an idle tower defense game. A central tower defends itself against incoming enemies. The player upgrades the tower with the money gained from killing enemies. Enemy powers increase with each wave until the player can no longer defend themselves. 

### Things to add
- Damage, money, upgrade texts, etc
- More enemy types
- Enemy dying animations

### Bugs
- Some projectiles 'miss'?
- Draw order - Enemies are drawn over health,

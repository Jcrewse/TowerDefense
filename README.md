# Idle Tower Defense
Author: Jack Crewse

A simple programming exercise to create an idle tower defense game. A central tower defends itself against incoming enemies. The player upgrades the tower with the resources gained from eliminating enemies. Enemy powers increase with each wave until the player can no longer defend themselves.

Features to add:
1. Weapon accuracy - Weapon fires probabilistically centered around target location
2. Enemy types - Ranged, Tank, Fast, Boss
3. Tower upgrades - Offense: damage, attack speed, accuracy, range; Defense: health, heal, armor, thorns
4. Game menus - Main menu, pause, game over
